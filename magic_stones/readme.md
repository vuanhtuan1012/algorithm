# Magic Stones

You have a number `N` of magic stones each of which has a level with a positive integer value.

The stones are very heavy and cumbersome to carry around.

Luckily you can use your magic powers to combine two stones of level `i` to form a single stone of level `i+1`.

Use your power to minimise the number of stones that you have.

**Input:** A list of stones with its level.

**Output:**  The minimum number of stones you can have.

**Example:**
- Input: `[1, 2, 1]`
- Output: `1`

**Constraints:** `0 <  N  < 1000`
